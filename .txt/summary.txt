## Summary:

The app is called Palit, which means to buy in Bisaya. It is a commerce app that connects nearby vendors and customers who want to buy or sell products or services on the spot. The app uses real time geolocation to show the locations of both parties on a map, and allows them to chat, create transactions, and rate transactions. The app aims to provide convenience, flexibility, and security for both vendors and customers.
We have identified a gap in the market for an app that caters to the needs of moving vendors, such as taho vendors, vendors who sell along the sidewalk, or vendors that use push carts to move around with their products. These vendors are often overlooked by other platforms that focus on fixed establishments or delivery services. According to a study by the University of San Carlos, there are around 3,000 moving vendors in Cebu City, who contribute to the informal economy and the livelihood of many families. However, they also face many challenges, such as lack of access to customers, unfair competition, harassment, and discrimination.
Our app seeks to address these challenges by providing the following benefits:
It helps improve the vendorsâ€™ sales, reach, and exposure by allowing them to be visible to potential customers within a certain distance limit, and by sending notifications to customers when there are nearby vendors offering their desired products or services.
It helps set a fixed price for the products or services to prevent discrimination towards foreigners by making the products overpriced. Customers can also see the total price of their order before confirming it, and pay only after receiving their order.
It helps protect the vendors from being deprived of their source of livelihood by giving them a platform to register their business, manage their store, and receive feedback from customers. It also helps them comply with the regulations of the local government, such as the ordinance that aims to regulate street vendors and market vendors without stalls.
Our app does not aim to replace GrabFood, Foodpanda, Shopee, or discovering stores via Google Maps, but to provide an alternative that uplifts moving vendors without fixed stalls or stores. We believe that our app can create a win-win situation for both vendors and customers, as well as contribute to the development and modernization of Cebu City.
