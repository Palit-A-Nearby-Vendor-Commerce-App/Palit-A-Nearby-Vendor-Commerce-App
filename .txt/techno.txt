## Summary:

The app is called Palit, which means to buy in Bisaya. It is a commerce app that connects nearby vendors and customers who want to buy or sell products or services on the spot. The app uses real time geolocation to show the locations of both parties on a map, and allows them to chat, create transactions, and rate transactions. The app aims to provide convenience, flexibility, and security for both vendors and customers.
We have identified a gap in the market for an app that caters to the needs of moving vendors, such as taho vendors, vendors who sell along the sidewalk, or vendors that use push carts to move around with their products. These vendors are often overlooked by other platforms that focus on fixed establishments or delivery services. According to a study by the University of San Carlos, there are around 3,000 moving vendors in Cebu City, who contribute to the informal economy and the livelihood of many families. However, they also face many challenges, such as lack of access to customers, unfair competition, harassment, and discrimination.
Our app seeks to address these challenges by providing the following benefits:
It helps improve the vendors’ sales, reach, and exposure by allowing them to be visible to potential customers within a certain distance limit, and by sending notifications to customers when there are nearby vendors offering their desired products or services.
It helps set a fixed price for the products or services to prevent discrimination towards foreigners by making the products overpriced. Customers can also see the total price of their order before confirming it, and pay only after receiving their order.
It helps protect the vendors from being deprived of their source of livelihood by giving them a platform to register their business, manage their store, and receive feedback from customers. It also helps them comply with the regulations of the local government, such as the ordinance that aims to regulate street vendors and market vendors without stalls.
Our app does not aim to replace GrabFood, Foodpanda, Shopee, or discovering stores via Google Maps, but to provide an alternative that uplifts moving vendors without fixed stalls or stores. We believe that our app can create a win-win situation for both vendors and customers, as well as contribute to the development and modernization of Cebu City.

features:
- **3 Types of Users**: Customers who will order from vendors. Vendors who will sell to customers and manage their own stores. service providers
- **Accounts**: Users can sign up. In the sign up screen they enter their email, name, birthdate, and choose if they are a customer or a vendor. Admins cannot log in normally in the /signin page. 
- **Map**: This is the screen that appears upon log in. Users can see their own location and the locations of other users (they can only see vendors' icons who are not admins if they are a customer, and only see customers' icons who are not admins if they are a vendor) within a certain distance limit (200 meters) on a map they also see a report icon to the lower left. Admins do not show up on the map. 
- service mode or product mode. the user can switch between 2 modes depending on whether they need products or services from nearby vendors or providers
- in app payment
- 
- **Custom Icons**: In customer's POV, the vendors show up as an icon depending on the services or the products they offer. We have created a fixed catalogue of categories that vendors can use to describe their stores such as fish, fruits, hats, etc. In vendor's pov the customer icons are either light blue with white stroke if they are not currently ordering and dark blue with white stroke if they are currently ordering.
- **Report**: In the map screen the both customers and vendors can see a report icon in the lower left which when pressed opens the report screen. Here they can input their message to the admins about bugs they faced, suggestions, or problems they had with other users.
- **Store as floating window in the map**: The store page will appear as a floating window in the right side of the map page. In vendor's pov, vendors can view their store by clicking on the my store icon at the bottom of the queue floating window. In the store, they can click the edit store button to enter edit mode and edit their store name, description, category which will determine the icon in the map, and products or services. They can also specify the name, price, and image of each product or service they offer. New vendors upon clicking my store, will show their empty store which have default stores with null names, description, and category and no products. Stores with no products will not appear in the map to prevent confusion. 

In the customer's pov, if no store has been selected yet, this floating window will show Select a vendor to 
see their store... When a vendors who have set up their store are nearby, they show up as icons in the customer's map. When customer selects a store, they can view the vendors' store name, description, category, and products or services. They can also select the quantity they want, and see the total price below. They can also place an order by tapping the order button, which will create a transaction object sent to the vendor thru chat, listing the products and quantities they selected with a status of in queue. The order button becomes a cancel order button when clicked.
- **Chat**: Vendors and customers can chat with each other for inquiries, negotiations, or feedback. Transactions created by the customers are also sent as messages in chat, where the status can change from in queue to now serving to completed or to cancelled. Vendors can accept orders by tapping the accept button in transaction object in chat or they can ignore it completely. Customers can cancel their orders by tapping the cancel button in the store page. Once the order is completed, customers can rate the vendor by filling out a 5 star form in chat which appears attached below the transaction object.

- **Customer queue as floating window in the map**: In vendor's pov, if no customer has ordered, this will show Waiting for customers... When there are ordering customers, the ordering customers will show up as a list with a header of In Queue. They are also visible as dark blue dots on the map. The vendor may click a customer in queue to open the chat page with that customer then click the accept order button to change the customer's status as now serving. The customer they are currently serving will appear in a red div with white text on top of the in queue list with a header "Now Serving" on top of the div. They also show up in the map as a red pin. When the vendor marks the order as complete in chat, the customer's status will change to completed and theyll revert as a light blue icon in map, disappearing from the queue.

		"It is impossible for you to obtain TAM SAM SOM using all data provided in the customer segment or end-user profile. Therefore, use the most important characteristics from the end user profile for your secondary research for TAM SAM SOM.

Other very specific data may not be easily searchable so use alternative information. E.g., If there is no search result for enrolled students from grades 1 to 3, search for the population of children from 8 to 11 years old and add the assumption that all children from 8 to 11 years old are enrolled and studying at school. If the percentage of out-of-school youth would be helpful to get a more reliable estimate, kindly factor it in. Always try to get the closest figure for TAM SAM SOM using several sources of information. "																									
																											
																											
																											
																											
																											
																											
																											
																											
		"List at least 5 end user profile characteristics for each category to determine the TAM SAM SOM. Add more characteristics when necessary.

Example: Gender, Income, Education, Affiliations, etc."

				3	Economic Status										Primarily lower middle-class and poor

	2. TAM SAM SOM																										
																											
																											
														Number of End Users													
					Total Addressable Market (TAM)							The informal economy in the Philippines, including street vendors, represents 38.3% of the employed population​​. Cebu City has approximately 6,000 displaced street vendors in the Carbon Market area​​. Additional vendors are spread across the city, with at least 800 registered under accredited associations​​ and up to 1,000 possibly returning to sidewalks​​.															
					Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)							Focusing on Cebu City, the SAM can be approximated by considering the total number of street vendors in the city, which is in the range of several thousand.															
					Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)							This would be a subset of SAM, targeted by the Palit app, likely focusing on those street vendors who are technologically savvy or willing to adopt new platforms for business enhancement.
