Palit-A-Nearby-Vendor-Commerce-App

# App Development Plan

## Summary:

The app is called Palit, which means to buy in Bisaya. It is a commerce app that connects nearby vendors and customers who want to buy or sell products or services on the spot. The app uses real time geolocation to show the locations of both parties on a map, and allows them to chat, create transactions, and rate transactions. The app aims to provide convenience, flexibility, and security for both vendors and customers.
We have identified a gap in the market for an app that caters to the needs of moving vendors, such as taho vendors, vendors who sell along the sidewalk, or vendors that use push carts to move around with their products. These vendors are often overlooked by other platforms that focus on fixed establishments or delivery services. According to a study by the University of San Carlos, there are around 3,000 moving vendors in Cebu City, who contribute to the informal economy and the livelihood of many families. However, they also face many challenges, such as lack of access to customers, unfair competition, harassment, and discrimination.
Our app seeks to address these challenges by providing the following benefits:
It helps improve the vendorsâ€™ sales, reach, and exposure by allowing them to be visible to potential customers within a certain distance limit, and by sending notifications to customers when there are nearby vendors offering their desired products or services.
It helps set a fixed price for the products or services to prevent discrimination towards foreigners by making the products overpriced. Customers can also see the total price of their order before confirming it, and pay only after receiving their order.
It helps protect the vendors from being deprived of their source of livelihood by giving them a platform to register their business, manage their store, and receive feedback from customers. It also helps them comply with the regulations of the local government, such as the ordinance that aims to regulate street vendors and market vendors without stalls.
Our app does not aim to replace GrabFood, Foodpanda, Shopee, or discovering stores via Google Maps, but to provide an alternative that uplifts moving vendors without fixed stalls or stores. We believe that our app can create a win-win situation for both vendors and customers, as well as contribute to the development and modernization of Cebu City.


## Name: Palit: A Commerce App for Nearby Vendors

## Functionalities
- **Realtime geolocation**: the app enables vendors and customers to see each other's locations on a map within a certain distance limit. Customers can also view the vendors' icons that indicate their goods or services.
- **Account**: users can create either a vendor or a customer account.
- **Vendor store management**: vendors can edit their store details and their products or services.
- **Customer store browsing**: customers can tap on a vendor icon on the map and see their store. They can select the products they want and see the total price at the bottom. They can also send their selections to the vendor by tapping the I'm interested button, which will create a transaction object with a status of either in queue or now serving, depending on whether there are other customers ahead of them or not. 
- **Chat**: vendors and customers can chat with each other for inquiries, negotiations, or feedback. 
- **Status area in the bottom of chat**: This shows the current status of the transaction, which could be in queue, now serving, or completed. For vendors, there is also a finish transaction button that they can press when the transaction is done, which will prompt the customer to rate the vendor. For customers, there is also a rate vendor button that they can use after the transaction is completed.
- **Vendor's pov - customer queue**: vendors can see the customers who are interested in buying from them as yellow dots on the map. The customer they are currently serving will appear as a red dot. Customers will receive notifications about their status changes, such as when they are being served or when the transaction is completed. The first customer who taps the I'm interested button will have a status of now serving, while the others will have a status of in queue. When the vendor presses the finish transaction button, the customer's status will change to completed and the next customer in line will have a status of now serving.
- **Cash on delivery**: customers only pay after receiving their ordered goods or services, similar to how traditional transactions work.
- **Notifications**: vendors and customers receive notifications when there are potential buyers or sellers near them. The notifications for customers include a brief summary of what the nearby vendor is offering.
- **Distance visibility limit**: to ensure that the transaction is feasible, the customer and vendor must be within a certain distance from each other, so they can only see nearby vendors (for customers) or customers (for vendors) on the map.

## Limitations
- **In-app payment**: we will not offer in-app payment due to the time constraint and security issues.
- **We are student newbie developers** who are still learning about the frameworks and APIs that we need to use.

## User Roles
- **Customers**: they buy products or services from the vendors. They may actively look for vendors on the map or wait for notifications from nearby vendors.
- **Vendors**: they sell products or services that they have with them or can provide on the spot. They may move around to find customers or wait for notifications from nearby buyers.

## Data Requirements
For customers:
- name
- birth date
- email (to be verified on sign up)

For vendors:
- name
- birth date
- email (to be verified on sign up)
- store name
- products/services and details

## Business Rules
1. Vendors need a verified email account to start selling
1. Customers need a verified email account to start buying

## Technical Requirements
- We will only create a web app.
- We will use React JS for the front end.
- We will use Springboot for the back end.
- We can use any API or framework that can help us with our development.

## User Interface/Experience (UI/UX) Design
We plan to make a responsive website that is mobile first.

We have planned to have these screens:
- Login or signup screen where the user can input their details only once to prevent fraud in the platform
- Chat screen which serves as the communication and notification center. It appears after the vendor taps on their current customer in queue or after the customer taps on I'm interested in the vendor's store. Notifications are posted as messages.

Vendor:
  - Map screen with customer locations for vendors, where customers turn red when being served and yellow when in queue
  - Customer queue at the bottom of the map for vendors
  - Store edit screen for vendors

Customer:
  - Map screen with vendor locations and icons for customers, where icons show what goods or services are offered
  - Store preview at the bottom of the map for customers when they tap on a vendor icon on the map
  - Store browse screen for customers


## Development Timeline
- 4 weeks

## Budget Estimate
- Zero budget

## Diagrams Needed
- 1 Use Case Diagram - System wide
- Multiple Use Case Diagrams - Specifics based on system wide use case
- Class Diagram - exactly 8 entities
- Activity Diagrams 
- Entity Relationship Diagram

## NOTICE
in a separate route, the admin page can be accessed where admins can sign up and login.
